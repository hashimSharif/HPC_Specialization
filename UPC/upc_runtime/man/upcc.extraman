[DESCRIPTION]

upcc is the front-end to the Berkeley UPC compiler suite.  It handles all
stages of the UPC compilation process: 1) initial preprocessing, 2) UPC-to-C
translation, 3) back-end C compilation, and 4) linking.  

upcc has the same interface as a traditional C compiler, plus some additional
flags for UPC-specific options. Default options to be used for every compilation
can be specified in the UPCC_FLAGS environment variable, and in the 
upcc configuration files (see below).

[UPC FILE EXTENSIONS]

upcc recognizes both `.c' and `.upc' as valid file name extensions for UPC code.
Header files may have either a `.uph' or `.h' extension.  

`.trans.c' is recognized specially as a file which has already been translated
(via a previous call to `upcc -trans').  upcc passes `.trans.c' files directly to
the C compiler/linker.


[REGULAR C FILES/OBJECTS/LIBRARIES]

Berkeley UPC is fully interoperable with regular C source, object, and library
files.  You may pass regular C files to upcc, include regular .h files in your
UPC code, and link C-based libraries and object files into a UPC application.

[CONFIGURATION FILES]

upcc uses a site-wide `upcc.conf' file to get some of its settings.  You may
override any of the settings found in the global `upcc.conf' file with a
user configuration file: `.upccrc' your $HOME directory.
Alternatively, you may pass `-conf=FILE' to specify a user configuration
file to be read in place of this default.  

The user configuration file may look something like

  var1 = value
  var2 = value2
  [section1]
  var3 = value2
  [section2]
  var3 = value4

When the file is processed, every assignment before the first `[...]' line
is processed.  Later assignments are processed only if the section name
matches the library configuration selected by
various compiler options such as `-g', `-O', `-gupc' and `-inst' (run `upcc -show-confs'
to list enabled configurations).
The `[...]' lines are typically of the form `[<config>]' where `<config>' is
one of the library configurations.  However, the section names are interpreted
as perl regular expressions, allowing for instance `[.*_gupc]' to define
a section that will apply to both the `dbg_gupc' and `opt_gupc'
configurations.

To choose a different default network (a.k.a. conduit) for your programs:

    default_network=<conduit>

Where supported values will be a site-specific subset of:
mpi, udp, smp, ibv, ofi, mxm, shmem, portals4, gemini, aries, pami.

To specify flags to pass to upcc each time it is invoked, set `default_options':

    default_options = -save-all-temps -v -DFOO=bar

To specify flags to pass to upcc each time it is invoked for a specific network (a.k.a. conduit), set `<conduit>_options':

    mpi_options = -v -DUSING_MPI=1

To override the default amount of shared memory (per UPC thread) to be used by
your UPC applications:

    shared_heap = 128MB   # or `2GB', etc.

To use a different UPC-to-C translator:

    translator = /path/to/translator         # local translator
    translator = http://foo.org/upcc.cgi     # remote via HTTP
    translator = foo.org:/path/to/translator # remote via SSH

See the Berkeley UPC User's Guide for more information on using a remote
translator.

To have upcc use the basename of the first file  argument for the executable
name (i.e., `upcc foo.upc bar.upc' will produce `foo' instead of `a.out'):

    smart_output = yes  #or put -smart-output in `default_options'

[ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES]

The UPCC_FLAGS environment variable can be set to pass any flags/arguments that
you wish to use for every invocation of upcc.  This is in addition to
the `default_options' parameter described above.

[OPTION PROCESSING]

Options are read from the site-wide and user-specific configuration files, the environment and the command-line.  The precedence of options is equivalent to parsing the options in the following order:

    default_options <conduit>_options UPCC_FLAGS command-line

For options which set a value (such as -T and -shared-heap), the last value seen is the one used.  Thus values on the command-line always take precedence over any others.

The `default_options' and `<conduit>_options' are taken from your user configuration file (see CONFIGURATION FILES, above) if present there, or from the site-wide upcc.conf otherwise.  If a given setting is present in both files only the settings in the user file are used; they are not additive.  However, passing the option -norc on the command-line or setting the UPCC_NORC environment variable will disable reading of the user configuration file, causing `default_options' and `<conduit>_options' to be taken only from the site-wide upcc.conf.

Arguments in `default_options', `<conduit>_options' and UPCC_FLAGS are split on whitespace, but single- or double-quotes will suppress splitting.  The backslash character `\\' does not have any special meaning.

To avoid ambiguity `-network=FOO' is not allowed in the `<conduit>_options' settings.  The options `-norc' and `-conf=FILE' are only permitted on the command-line.  However the affect of `-norc' can also be achieved by setting UPCC_NORC.

Due to limitations in upcc and the tools it invokes, the following characters
may not appear in any argument that denotes a file or directory name:
.RS
    (){}[]<>"\`\'$|%^?:;!#&*\\
.RE

Upcc is able to deal with whitespace characters in directory names,
but not in file names.  Additionally, some of the tools upcc relies on
(e.g. some back-end MPI compilers) may not handle spaces in directory
names (e.g. in arguments to -I and -L).  Therefore, use of whitespace
in file names is prohibited, and use in directory names is
strongly discouraged.

[CONTROLLING OPTIMIZATIONS]

.SS "Optimization Related Options"

The BUPC translator supports several UPC specific optimizations.  The upcc 
driver provides the
.B -opt
command line option to enable a default set of optimizations.
In addition, optimizations can be individually enabled/disabled 
using the
.B -opt-enable
and
.B -opt-disable
driver options: 
.RS
.B -opt-enable=LIST
.br
.B -opt-disable=LIST 
.RE

These commands take the form shown above, where
.I LIST
is a comma separated
list of individual optimization names (enumerated below).  Example:
.RS
.B -opt-disable=pre-add
.RE

The optimizations currently supported by BUPC are:
.RS
split-phase
.br
pre-add
.br
ptr-coalesce
.br
ptr-locality
.br
forall-opt
.br
msg-vect
.RE

Invoking upcc with the
.B -opt
option will enable by default:
.B pre-add
and
.BR ptr-coalesce .
Note, however,  that these defaults may change in a future release.

The BUPC translator allows a per function control over optimizations
using pragmas.  For example
.RS
#pragma bupc noopt
.br
void F() {}
.RE
will disable any optimization during the compilation of 
.BR F() ,
regardless
of the upcc command line arguments.  The upcc command line arguments will 
determine the level of optimization for all other functions present in the
same file as
.BR F() .

.SS "Optimization Passes"

.B \(bu split-phase
.br
.B \(bu pre-add
.br
These two optimizations enable program transformations for pointer based codes written with fine grained memory accesses.  Consider this sample code:
.RS
shared int *p;
.br
int x,i;
.br
 \.\.\.
.br
x = p[i];
.RE

Without optimizations, the dereference
.B p[i]
will be performed using a
blocking communication call and no overlap is exploited.  The 
.B split-phase
optimization enables a transformation pass that generates non-blocking
communication calls and moves as far apart as possible in the program
the initiation of the operation from its completion.  This optimization
is designed to increase the amount of overlap present in the application.

Pointer arithmetic on pointers to shared (PTS) is an expensive operation.
The
.B pre-add
optimization attempts to reduce the number of PTS arithmetic operations
at runtime by performing a partial redundancy elimination
transformation.  This optimization is useful for both pointer and
array based codes written in a fine grained style. 

Note that the
.B pre-add
optimization performs speculative code motion 
and it might result in code that will fail runtime assertions when using
versions of the UPC runtime library built with debug options.  Versions
built with optimized runtime libraries will perform correctly.

For more information on these optimizations see:
``Communication Optimizations for Fine-grained UPC Applications''
W. Chen, C. Iancu, K. Yelick. 
.I 14th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques
.IR (PACT) ,
2005.


.B \(bu ptr-coalesce

This optimization is beneficial for pointer based programs using aggregate
data types.  Given 
.RS
struct S {
.br
    int x; 
.br
    int y;
.br
};
.br
 \.\.\.
.br
shared struct S *p;
.br
int x;
.br
int y;
.br
 \.\.\.
.br
x = p->x;
.br
y = p->y; 
.RE

The unoptimized code will perform two network transfers.  The
.B ptr-coalesce
optimization detects accesses to contiguous fields within an aggregate data
type and efficiently transfers the data using a single communication operation.

.B \(bu ptr-locality

This enables an intra-procedural analysis able to replace accesses using 
PTS  with accesses using `C' pointers within one function.  The transformation
is designed to facilitate data initialization and associates calls
to
.BR upc_alloc ()
(memory allocation with local affinity) to the uses of the
returned pointer.  The transformed program will benefit from lower PTS
arithmetic overhead and faster data access. 
This optimization has to be explicitly requested using the
.B -opt-enable
option.


.B \(bu forall-opt 

Given a forall loop
.RS
upc_forall(...; ...; ...;
.IR aff ) 
.RE
this optimization analyzes the affinity expression
.RI ( aff ),
determines the 
iterations of the loop with local affinity and generates efficient serial
code without affinity tests.
This optimization has to be explicitly requested using the
.B -opt-enable
option.


.B \(bu msg-vect

This option enables an alpha release of a loop optimization package
designed for array based programs.  This feature is EXPERIMENTAL and
has to be explicitly requested using the
.B -opt-enable
option.  For a more detailed description see:

``Performance Portable Optimizations for Loops Containing Communication 
Operations''
C. Iancu, W. Chen, K. Yelick.
.I International Conference on Supercomputing 2008
(ICS 2008).

For a given loop nest, the optimization detects the memory regions 
accessed through PTS and generates efficient code for the transfer of the
remote data.  There are two types of code transformations: strip-mining
transformations and detection of `scatter-gather' operations.
 
The optimizations use a combination of compile time and runtime
analysis.  The runtime analysis allows user customization and is
implemented in the upcr_trans_extra_vect.{c,h} files in the libupc
directory of the BUPC translator installation.  These files are
recompiled and linked against the user application at any upcc
invocation.

Vectorization for a given loop nest can be requested using pragmas, i.e.
.RS
#pragma bupc ivdep
.br
for(i = 0; ...; ...) { }
.RE

The performance models in upcrt_trans_extra_vect.c have been tuned
for several systems, identified by their name.  For unknown
systems the defaults are: no strip mining and scatter-gather (VIS) code
generation.  Note that the GASNet implementation of VIS operations
can be controlled using the GASNET_VIS_AMPIPE environment variable.

When message vectorization is requested with
.BR -opt-enable=msg-vect , 
the BUPC translator is able to print a report of the attempted
transformations and their success.  This functionality is enabled
passing 
.B -Wu,"-Wb,-trace-msg-vect"
as in this example:
.RS
upcc -opt-enable=msg-vect -Wu,"-Wb,-trace-msg-vect" ...   
.RE

[A MAKEFILE EXAMPLE]

The following small Makefile shows how you might handle the .upc extension if
you use `make' to build your programs:

    _______________________________________________________

    # A simple Makefile for building UPC programs

    TARGET          = foobar
    UPCC            = upcc
    UPCFLAGS       = -g

    UPC_OBJS        = foo.o bar.o

    .SUFFIXES:
    .SUFFIXES: .upc .o

    # suffix rule for compiling .upc files 
    .upc.o:
            $(UPCC) -c $(UPCFLAGS) -o $@ $<

    $(TARGET): $(UPC_OBJS)
            $(UPCC) $(UPCFLAGS) -o $(TARGET) $(UPC_OBJS)
    _______________________________________________________

    $make 
    upcc -c -g foo.upc
    upcc -c -g bar.upc
    upcc -g -o foobar foo.o bar.o

Alternatively, if you use the .c extension for your UPC files, you can simply
set the CC variable in your Makefile (or your shell environment) to `upcc',
after which the regular make rules for C files will handle your UPC files (and
the standard CFLAGS variable can be set to pass upcc options).

[STATIC VS DYNAMIC THREADS]

When invoked with the `-T' option, upcc will generate an executable (or object file
if `-c' is also passed) that can only be run with a fixed thread count (the argument to `-T').
Such a compilation is defined by the UPC specification as taking place in a
`static THREADS' environment, as compared to a `dynamic THREADS' environment
when `-T' is not used.  As an extension, Berkeley UPC allows linking of 
objects compiled with dynamic THREADS with those compiled with static THREADS.
The result is always an executable able to run only with the fixed thread count of the
static THREADS object file(s).

Use of dynamic THREADS objects in this manner provides the flexibility to compile
a single object from UPC sources for use with multiple possible
THREAD values, while still allowing the remainder of ones code to be compiled for
static THREADS with its potential for more aggressive compiler optimizations.  In
this way dynamic THREADS objects can be used much like libraries.  However, one
should be aware of certain limitations:
.RS
.B \(bu
This practice may not be supported by other UPC compilers.
.br
.B \(bu
The dynamic THREADS object(s) will not include any optimizations that might
be available exclusively in a static THREADS environment.
.br
.B \(bu
The rules regarding use of THREADS in variable declarations in a dynamic THREADS
environment do not change when linking with static THREADS objects.
.br
.B \(bu
The terms `static' and `dynamic' used with respect to UPC THREADS have no
relation to the terms 'static library' and 'dynamic library'.
