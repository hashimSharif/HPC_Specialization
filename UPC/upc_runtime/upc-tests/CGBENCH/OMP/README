INSTALLATION

    This directory includes the CG OMP implementation.
    To install the benchmark, first create a directory
    called bin under the OMP subdirectory. Second, run 
    the make file Makefile by the following format:
       make <Bench mark> <Class> <THREADS> 

       where <Bench mark> := "CG"
                  <Class> := "A" | "B" | 
                             "C" | "S" | "W" 
                <THREADS> := nature number

    It generates an executable (under bin) named 
    cg.CLASS.THREADS (the threads number is auxiliary since it 
    is specified by enviroment OMP_NUM_THREADS
    during execution)

    To run the executable, set the environment variable
    first and run the executable as shown below (C shell) 
        >setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS <Threads number>
        ><executable>
