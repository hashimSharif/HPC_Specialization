This directory contains a snapshot of the guts_main directory from
GUTS (GWU Unified Testing Suite) which has been *slightly* modified
to run under the Berkeley UPC test harness.  These modifications and
the associated harness.conf file were contributed by Gary Funck, who
summarized them as follows:

> The files were copied from
> the guts_main/src directory of the latest guts
> release along with the single file, gula.h, under
> the include directory.  The source files were updated
> to print a "Passed." message as appropiate and the
> GULA_FAIL macro was changed to prefix the error message
> with a prefix that includes the string "Error:", along
> with the source file/line where the error occurred.
> Other than that, everything is the same as the original.

In addition to that work to integrate cleanly into the Berkeley UPC
test harness, there may be bug fixes applied to certain tests.  We have
made an effort to comment each non-obvious difference from GWU's code.

The README and CHANGELOG are unmodified copies of those files from the
top-level directory of GWU's GUTS distribution.
