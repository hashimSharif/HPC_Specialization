		GWU Unified Testing Suite (GUTS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

GUTS is a new framework which includes various UPC testing suites. The main 
goal behind this new framework is to hold different UPC testing benches in a
single unified environment as much as possible. 

This README file contains general information for GUTS, if you would like to
know more about the specific testing suites please go to those directories 
and refer to the information provided there.

Quick Overview:
----------------

Currently GUTS include the following test benches:
	
	1- guts_main: This is the main UPC testing suite for the language specification
	compliance check for the UPC compilers

	2- guts_io: This is the testing suite for the UPC/IO library 

	3- guts_collectives: This is the testing suite released by Michigan Tech University
	and it is used for testing the UPC/Collectives library

	4- guts_coa: This bench provides performance optimization testing on the compilers by running
	some of the kernels from the NAS Parallel Benchmarks 

Again for more information in any of these testing suites please go to that specific
directory and use the README file. 

Background information and changes:
------------------------------------

GUTS is a modified version of the previous GWU testing efforts especially 
Unified UPC Test Framework (UUTF) which was released June 2005. It differs 
mainly in the testing strategy i.e. GUTS follow the "unit" based testing 
wherever possible (guts_io & guts_main). Also, GUTS includes various bug fixes 
and modifications to previous release. Last but not least, GUTS tries to provide 
clear information as the output of testing by going through each unit one by one and 
at the end including statistics for the whole run.

For more information on the official releases of the test suites, please refer to 
http://upc.gwu.edu.

Requirements:
--------------

Please refer to the README files provided for each sub testing suite.
GUTS itself does not require to be installed and requires only working UPC compiler.

How to use GUTS?
----------------

There are two main alternatives to use GUTS for testing purposes.
	
	1- Use the "guts.sh" script provided in the top directory and run any of the testing
	suite by specifying the name in the command line
	
	2- Use the scripts provided inside each testing suite to run that specific test bench
	e.g. to run the UPC/IO testing suite first go to "guts_io" directory, refer to the 
	README file provided for any specific information, and run the test bench using the 
	script provided in that directory which is "guts_io.sh" by calling
		./guts_io.sh [#of threads] [COMPILER]

User does not need to compile anything, every source file is compiled and run accordingly 
using the scripts provided. Statistical output is provided at the end where applicable.
