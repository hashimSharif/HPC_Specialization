This directory contains a copy of the nbp-upc distribution from
George Washington University, version 2.4-11.02, which has been
*slightly* modified to run under the Berkeley UPC test harness,
and updated to track fixes committed to GWU's svn.

The initial modifications and the associated harness.conf file were
contributed by Gary Funck.

In addition to harness.conf to integrate cleanly into the Berkeley UPC
test harness, there may be bug fixes applied to certain tests.  We have
made an effort to identify each difference from GWU's code by a comment
containing "BUPC" or by "#if(n)def BUPC_TEST_HARNESS".

All such fixes/changes are reported to GWU.  Once they are accepted by
GWU the "BUPC" comment or #ifdef may be removed.  For that reason if
you compare to the 2.4-11.02 release you will probably find uncommented
differences.  The contents of this directory most closely correspond to
GWU's svn revision 78.
