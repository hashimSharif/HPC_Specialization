# ====================================================================
# System configuration file for the UPC test harness
#
# Notes on syntax/semantics:
# -------------------------
# (1) Comments, as in PERL, begin with the pound (#) symbol and
#     continue until the end of the line
#	
# (2) local definitions.  Lines of the form:
#     define NAME = value
#     will define a substitution, that can be used as shorthand
#     in later entries.  See item 5 below.   
#
# (3) The data in the file consists of a series of definitions in
#     the form: 
#          name = value
#     where "name" is a string and value is either:
#          a scalar value,   eg:  foo = bar
#          a hash            eg:  foo = { a => 5; b => upc }
#          an array          eg:  foo = [x, y, z]
#     That is, similar to how you would write them in PERL.
# 
# (4) values of the form '%HOME%' (uppercase surrounded by percent)
#     will be replaced by the corresponding local definition (see 2)
#     if it is defined, or the corresponding environment variable.
#     It is a run-time error if such a definition or environment 
#     variable is not defined.
#
# (5) The following values must be defined:
#     network         NOTE: can be modified on command line
#     batch_sys
#     queues
#
# ====================================================================

# Specify the network [GASNet conduit] to be used

network = lapi

# Specify the type of batch system in use.  Currently I know about
# PBS, SGE, RMS_ALLOCATE, INTERACTIVE and LOADLEVELER

batch_sys = loadleveler

# Specify a sequence of queues, in order of preference, that can
# be used to run the jobs.  Each queue must define the following
# fields:
#      Q_name     -> name of the queue
#      Q_maxnode  -> max number of nodes allowed by the queue
#      Q_minnode  -> min number of nodes allowed by the queue
#      Q_maxtpn   -> max number of tasks per node allowed by queue
#      Q_maxtime  -> the maximum queue limit for the queue
#                    in the form HHH:MM:SS

queues = [
        {
          Q_name     => debug,   
          Q_maxnode  => 24,      
          Q_minnode  => 1,       
	  Q_maxtpn   => 16,      
	  Q_maxtime  => 00:29:30 
        },
        {
          Q_name     => regular, 
          Q_maxnode  => 380,     
          Q_minnode  => 1,       
	  Q_maxtpn   => 16,      
	  Q_maxtime  => 11:59:30 
        }
]

# =================================================================
# Optional (but suggested) fields

# Specify the accounting repository under which the jobs will be run
# (not used on all systems)

repository = foobar

# Specify the default number of UPC threads when running the tests.
# This value will replace the %NTHREAD% string in the per-suite
# harness configuration file (harness.conf).

nthread_default = 2

# Specify the maximum number of processes per node to be used in this run

max_proc_per_node = 4

# Specify the minimum number of nodes to be used in a run.  This 
# value will be violated if the total number of UPC threads is 
# less than the specified value

min_num_nodes = 1
