This directory contains UTS v1.1 obtained from
   http://barista.cse.ohio-state.edu/wiki/index.php/UTS

A several changes have been made to the sources, all of which are compiled
conditional on the definition of the pre-processor token "BUPC_TEST_HARNESS".
These changes have been made in such a way that a tool such as emacs's
hide-ifdef-mode can recover the original program text, even when doing so
results in otherwise needless duplication of code.

The following files are added for use with the Berkeley UPC test harness:
    README.harness (this file)
    harness.conf (orignal version contributed by Gary Funck)
    Makefile.harness (wrapper around the orignal Makefile)
